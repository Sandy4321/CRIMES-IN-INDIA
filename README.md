# CRIMES-IN-INDIA
This project predicts the number of police officers of various rank that should be allotted in all the states of the country so as to ensure less crime rate and hence the overall security of public.  Basic study design: This project is based on the study of various types of crime including ransom, murder, revenge, body parts selling etc. and analysing their relationship with the working police officers of various ranks ( i.e. DSP, SSP, SP, inspector, sub-inspector, constable, etc.)  With this available data, interpretation of which crime is more affected by the increase or decrease in number of different category of police officers has been done. Knowing the pattern of the crime rates before hand, we can predict the required number of police officers in different states would be made efficiently.
